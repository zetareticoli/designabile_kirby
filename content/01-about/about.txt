Intro: Designabile is the small, creative design studio of designer and author Francesco Improta. Founded in 2010, it's located in the centre of Rome.



I work with clients from all around the world, directly collaborating with agencies or in solo position. And I'm freaking good with it.

Bio: 
My name is Francesco Improta, italian designer living in sunny Rome, Italy.

With more 7 years of experience in the web design field, I’m specialised in Interaction Design and User Interface Design. But I can code my own designs too. 

After 5 and more years working as web designer for agencies I started a new journey as freelancer running my own design studio. Previously I was the co-founder and lead designer of the domains management service [RoboDomain](http://robodomain.com/ "Robodomain website").

I’m particularly interested in touch-screen and mobile interfaces, user experience and typography.

Occasionally I write and talk about design and web. I enjoy sharing my approach to web design by writing, attending and speaking at conferences and events. I'm the co-author of [CSS3 Solution](http://www.apress.com/9781430243359 "CSS3 Solutions the book") and writed several articles for [HTML.it](http://html.it "HTML.it website") and [UXMagazine](http://http://www.uxmagazine.it/author/francesco-improta/ "UXMagazine Francesco Improta's articles").
